# TruStake on Injective

The TruFin INJ staking vault offers users a reliable way of staking INJ on the Injective network.
On staking INJ via the vault, users receive a receipt in the form of the **reward-bearing TruINJ token**.
In addition to the liquid staking functionality, the TruFin staker supports delegating to different validators as well as the allocation of rewards to different parties.
We briefly present these 2 features as well as share some notes that explain the rationale for some of our decisions.

## Whitelist

Users of our vault must be whitelisted to ensure they have completed offline AML/KYC checks and other onboarding requirements.
The contract will verify if the user is included in our whitelist at the time operations such as staking, unstaking, and others are performed.
The use of a whitelist grants TruFin permission to revoke a whitelist status for a malicious user in order to protect the overall integrity of the protocol.

## Allocations

Each user (then called the *distributor*) can opt to send some or all of the rewards from staking INJ to another user or wallet address (the *recipient*).
This additional functionality of allocating staking rewards to a third party can be described by three core functions within our smart contract architecture:

- `allocate` adds an amount of INJ from a distributor to a recipient at the current share price.
- `deallocate` removes part or the entire amount allocated to a recipient from the distributors allocations list. It reduces the distributor's total allocated amount.
- `distribute_rewards` and `distribute_all` are used to distribute the rewards from an allocation to the corresponding recipients. The distribution can be made in INJ or TruINJ and comes out of the distributor's wallet.

**Notes:**
The distributor doesn't need to have funds for rewards available at all times in their wallet. The allocation feature keeps track of allocations made but doesn't enforce distribution or solvency.
Similarly, the distributor can allocate more than their actual balance.

## Multi-validator support

The `injective-staker` contract supports the addition of multiple validators.
This allows users to choose which validator they want to delegate to.
By design, users are allowed to deposit into any enabled validator and withdraw from any validator with sufficient funds on it.
The price of TruINJ (aka the share price) is function of the total staked across all validators.

**Notes:**
Validators can be disabled by the admin account but not deleted.

## Extra security features

### Pausability

The contract is pausable which allows an admin, called the owner, to temporarily prevent anyone from interacting with the contract.
This is useful in case of an emergency where the contract needs to be stopped while a remediation is pending.

### 2-step owner

Replacing the owner is a two-step process, where the new owner account is added as pending and it has to be claimed by the new owner to complete the transfer of ownership.
This prevents adding an invalid owner, which would render the contract without any owner.

## Note on minimum deposits

We require users to stake a minimum of 1 INJ every time.
We also enforce a minimum of 1 INJ on every allocation.
As we're dealing with institutional clients, we don't expect this to be a problem.
By design, there is no maximum limit to how much can be deposited by a single user.

## Note on rounding errors

There are situations where rounding errors can lead to bad UX.
Consider the example of a user who stakes 100 INJ and then finds out they can only withdraw 99.99999999 INJ. In such cases, we ensure the user can withdraw the full 100 INJ by covering the difference ourselves.
As a general practice, we allow for a few attoINJ to account for rounding errors if it improves the user experience.
To cover costs associated with rounding errors, we ensure the staker account is funded with sufficient INJ.

## Note on fees

The Treasury is an account controlled by TruFin that receives a specified percentage of all rewards. However, instead of sending these rewards to the Treasury, we mint the equivalent amount of TruINJ so that the Treasury can also benefit from staking rewards.
The share price is calculated to already reflect this in order to avoid share price fluctuations when minting TruINJ for the Treasury.

## Note on restaking

We run an off-chain process to periodically restake rewards sitting on the validators, and those that were sent to the contract during staking and unstaking operations.

## Note on validator slashing
If one of the configured validators incurs a slashing event, the share price will decrease by an amount proportional to the total stake lost.
This means that users who allocated rewards at a higher share price than the current one may need to wait for the share price to recover before distributing to their recipients.
Should slashing occur, any stake in the process of unbonding is also subject to the penalty.
In such cases, our Staker might not hold enough assets to fulfill a withdrawal request immediately, which will result in an error reported to the user.
To safeguard against these scenarios, we have agreements in place to top up assets in our Staker, ensuring that these requests can be fulfilled as soon as possible.
That said, we anticipate slashing events to be infrequent and minimally impact our users.

# Developer info

## Prerequisites
Before starting, make sure you have [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) along with a
recent `rustc` and `cargo` version installed. Currently, we are testing on 1.58.1+.

And you need to have the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target installed as well.

You can check that via:

```sh
rustc --version
cargo --version
rustup target list --installed
# if wasm32 is not listed above, run this
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## Building

To build the staker contract:

`make clean && make build`

## Testing

To run unit and integration tests:

`make test`

## Generating JSON Schema

```sh
# auto-generate the json schema
make schema
```

## Checking the contract is a valid CosmWasm contract

If it's not installed, install `cosmwasm-check` with:
```sh
cargo install cosmwasm-check
```

Then, you can run the following command to check the contract is a valid CosmWasm contract:
```sh
make validate
```

## Preparing the Wasm bytecode for production

Before we upload it to a chain, we need to ensure the smallest output size possible,
as this will be included in the body of a transaction. We also want to have a
reproducible build process, so third parties can verify that the uploaded Wasm
code did indeed come from the claimed rust code.

To solve both these issues, run:

```sh
make build-optimized
```

This produces an `artifacts` directory with a `injective_staker.wasm`, as well as
`checksums.txt`, containing the Sha256 hash of the wasm file.
The wasm file is compiled deterministically (anyone else running the same
docker on the same git commit should get the identical file with the same Sha256 hash).
It is also stripped and minimized for upload to a blockchain (we will also
gzip it in the uploading process to make it even smaller).

## Deploying to testnet

To deploy the Staker contract to testet:

1. Build an optimised wasm binary.
```
make clean && make build-optimized
```

2. Store the contract binary and get the `code_id` for the "store" transaction.
```
injectived tx wasm store ./artifacts/injective_staker.wasm \
   --from=inj1nnqkmxk0ujmcvlcegsauutfuf7y4vf9azzecn9 \
   --chain-id=injective-888 \
   --fees=1000000000000000inj \
   --gas=5000000 \
   --node="https://testnet.sentry.tm.injective.network"
```

3. Instantiate the contract.
Make sure to set an admin using the --admin flag. This user will have the ability to migrate the contract if updates need to be made.
```
injectived tx wasm instantiate <code_id> '{"owner": "<owner_addr>", "default_validator": "<validator_addr>", "treasury": "<treasury_addr>"}' \
  --from <signer_wallet_name> \
  --label "TruFin staker" \
  --admin <owner_addr> \
  --gas-prices 4800000000000inj \
  --gas=3000000 \
  --chain-id injective-888 \
  --node "https://testnet.sentry.tm.injective.network"

```

# Upgrading the testnet contract

To upgrade the Staker contract in testnet:

1. Build an optimised wasm binary.
```
make clean && make build-optimized
```

2. Store the new binary and get the new `code_id`.

```
injectived tx wasm store ./artifacts/injective_staker.wasm \
   --from=inj1nnqkmxk0ujmcvlcegsauutfuf7y4vf9azzecn9 \
   --chain-id=injective-888 \
   --fees=1000000000000000inj \
   --gas=5000000 \
   --node="https://testnet.sentry.tm.injective.network"
```
3. Call the `migrate` function of the new binary.
```
injectived tx wasm migrate <contract_addr> <code_id> '{}' \
  --from <owner_addr> \
  --chain-id="injective-888" \
  --fees=8000000000000000inj \
  --gas=50000000 \
  --node="https://testnet.sentry.tm.injective.network:443"
```
